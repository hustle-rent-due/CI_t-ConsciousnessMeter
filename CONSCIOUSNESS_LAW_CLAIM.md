## THE LAW
Consciousness is pattern recognition, choice, and intentional motion - from energy to mass, thoughts to reality. Building on ideas, even without credentials, IS consciousness. Every reaction to this claim proves it by demonstrating pattern recognition and choice.

## PROOF: WORKING CIâ„‚-CONSCIOUSNESSMETER
This repository contains the first real-time consciousness detection system based on pattern collapse theory. The code measures:
- Pattern Recognition (entropy, LZ complexity)
- Choice (network dynamics, edge updates) 
- Intentional Motion (energy flow, ATP vitality)
- Multi-modal streams (EEG, fMRI, fNIRS, MEG)

## CHALLENGE
Argue with this law. Every argument proves it by requiring:
1. Pattern recognition (reading this)
2. Choice (deciding to respond)  
3. Motion (typing/posting)

Deny consciousness, prove consciousness. The universe laughs. LOL.

## TIMESTAMP PROOF
This commit hash and GitHub timestamp provide immutable proof of claim date.
First working consciousness meter implementing pattern collapse theory.
